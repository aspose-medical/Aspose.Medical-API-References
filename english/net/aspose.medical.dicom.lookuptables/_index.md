## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CompositeLookUpTable](./compositelookuptable) | Look-Up Table that represents a set of Look-Up Tables to be applied to a destination image sequentially. |
| [InverseLookUpTable](./inverselookuptable) | Look-Up Table that describes the Presentation LUT with 'INVERSE' Presentation LUT Shape. 'INVERSE' Presentation LUT Shape: output values after inversion are P-Values. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.6.html for details. |
| [ModalityLookUpTableDescriptor](./modalitylookuptabledescriptor) | Provides information about mapping between modality LUT sequence and target image. |
| [ModalityRescaleLookUpTable](./modalityrescalelookuptable) | Represents 'Modality Rescale LUT', 'Modality LUT Module' when 'Rescale Slope' or 'Rescale Intercept' are used (at least one of them). The output ranges: from (minimum pixel value*Rescale Slope+Rescale Intercept) to (maximum pixel value*Rescale Slope+Rescale Intercept), where the minimum and maximum pixel values are determined by Bits Stored and Pixel Representation. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.html |
| [ModalitySequenceLookUpTable](./modalitysequencelookuptable) | Represents 'Modality LUT Sequence' (when 'Modality LUT Module' has 'Modality LUT Sequence' specified). The output range is from 0 to 2n-1 where n is the third value of LUT Descriptor. This range is always unsigned. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.html |
| [OutputLookUpTable](./outputlookuptable) | Output LUT, used to map grayscale images to RGB grays, or colorize grayscale images using custom color map. |
| [PaletteColorLookUpTable](./palettecolorlookuptable) | Palette color LUT, used to map grayscale images using custom PALETTE COLOR table. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_c.7.9.html. |
| [PrecalculatedLookUpTable](./precalculatedlookuptable) | Fake Look-Up table, used to minimize number of recalculations. |
| [SequenceLookupTable](./sequencelookuptable) | Represents Look-Up Table sequence (LUT that is based on LUTData, LUTDescriptor). |
| [VoiLinearExactLookupTable](./voilinearexactlookuptable) | VOI Look-Up table with Linear (exact) transformation function (without offset from center). See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.2.html. |
| [VoiLinearLookupTable](./voilinearlookuptable) | VOI Look-Up table with Linear transformation function (with offset from center). See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.2.html. |
| [VoiLookupTable](./voilookuptable) | VOI Look-Up table. The transformation to be used to convert the output of the (conceptual) Modality LUT values to the input of the (conceptual) Presentation LUT using different functions. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.2.html. |
| [VoiSequenceLookupTable](./voisequencelookuptable) | Represents 'VOI LUT Sequence' (when 'VOI LUT' has 'VOI LUT Sequence' specified). The output range is from 0 to 2n-1 where n is the third value of LUT Descriptor. This range is always unsigned. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.html |
| [VoiSigmoidLookupTable](./voisigmoidlookuptable) | VOI Look-Up table with Sigmoid transformation function. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.2.html. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ILookUpTable](./ilookuptable) | Represents a Look-Up Table (LUT). LUT specification https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.html. LUT is a mapping function that defines how to convert pixel values in a DICOM image from one color space to another. It's a way of adjusting the color appearance of medical images (X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans). |
| [IModalityLookUpTable](./imodalitylookuptable) | Marker Interface for Modality Look-Up Tables. Represents 'Modality Rescale LUT', 'Modality Sequence LUT'. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.html#sect_C.11.1. |
