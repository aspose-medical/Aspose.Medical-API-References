## PlanarConfiguration enumeration

Planar Configuration (0028,0006) indicates whether the color pixel data are sent color-by-plane or color-by-pixel. This Attribute shall be present if Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value greater than 1. It shall not be present otherwise. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.8.5.6.html#sect_C.8.5.6.1.16.

```csharp
public enum PlanarConfiguration
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interleaved | `0` | The sample values for the first pixel are followed by the sample values for the second pixel, etc. For RGB images, this means the order of the pixel values sent shall be R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2, ..., etc. |
| Planar | `1` | Each color plane shall be sent contiguously. For RGB images, this means the order of the pixel values sent is R1, R2, R3, ..., G1, G2, G3, ..., B1, B2, B3, etc. |
