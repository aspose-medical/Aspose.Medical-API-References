## PhotometricInterpretation.YbrIct property

Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (Cb and Cr). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both Cb and Cr values equal to zero. Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YCbCr Photometric Interpretation: Y = + .29900R + .58700G + .11400B Cb = - .16875R - .33126G + .50000B Cr = + .50000R - .41869G - .08131B See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_c.7.6.3.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.2:~:text=the%20third%20etc.-,YBR_ICT,-Irreversible%20Color%20Transformation. Read-only [`PhotometricInterpretation`](../../photometricinterpretation).
