## PhotometricInterpretation.YbrPartial420 property

The same as YBR_PARTIAL_422 except that the Cb and Cr values are sampled horizontally and vertically at half the Y rate and as a result there are four times less Cb and Cr values than Y values, versus twice less for YBR_PARTIAL_422. This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. The Cb and Cr values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For the first Row of Pixels (etc.), the first Cb and Cr samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next Cb and Cr samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc. The next Rows of Pixels containing Cb and Cr samples (at the same locations than for the first Row) will be the third etc. See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_c.7.6.3.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.2:~:text=PS3.3%2D2017b.-,YBR_PARTIAL_420,-Pixel%20data%20represent. Read-only [`PhotometricInterpretation`](../../photometricinterpretation).
