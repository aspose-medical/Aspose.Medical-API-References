## PhotometricInterpretation.YbrPartial422 property

The same as YBR_FULL_422 except that: black corresponds to Y = 16; Y is restricted to 220 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 235); Cb and Cr each has a minimum value of 16; Cb and Cr are restricted to 225 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 240); lack of color is represented by Cb and Cr equal to 128. In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_PARTIAL_422 Photometric Interpretation: Y = + .2568R + .5041G + .0979B + 16 Cb = - .1482R - .2910G + .4392B + 128 Cr = + .4392R - .3678G - .0714B + 128 See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_c.7.6.3.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.2:~:text=2008%5D.-,YBR_PARTIAL_422,-Retired.%20See%20PS3.3.
