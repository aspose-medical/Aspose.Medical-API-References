## PhotometricInterpretation.YbrFull property

Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (Cb and Cr). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both Cb and Cr values equal to half full scale. In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has a value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation: Y = + .2990R + .5870G + .1140B Cb = - .1687R - .3313G + .5000B + 128 Cr = + .5000R - .4187G - .0813B + 128 See https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_c.7.6.3.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.2:~:text=Retired.-,YBR_FULL,-Pixel%20data%20represent.
