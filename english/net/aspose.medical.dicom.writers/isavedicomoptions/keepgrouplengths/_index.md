### Remarks

DICOM specification PS 3.5 7.2 (https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part05.html#sect_7.2): Group Length (gggg,0000) Data Elements were implicitly defined for Standard and Private Data Element groups with a Value Representation of UL and a Value Multiplicity of 1, but have been retired. Consider to remove Group Length.
