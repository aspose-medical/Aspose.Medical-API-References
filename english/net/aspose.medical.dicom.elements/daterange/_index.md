## DateRange structure

Encapsulates Date (Time, Date Time) Range Matching functionality. See specification [https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part04/sect_C.2.2.2.5.html#sect_C.2.2.2.5.3](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part04/sect_C.2.2.2.5.html#sect_C.2.2.2.5.3)

C.2.2.2.5.1 Range Matching of Attributes of VR of DA.

a. A string of the form "`date1` - `date2`", where `date1` is less or equal to `date2`, shall match all occurrences of dates that fall between `date1` and `date2` inclusive

b. A string of the form "- `date1`" shall match all occurrences of dates prior to and including `date1`

c. A string of the form "`date1` -" shall match all occurrences of `date1` and subsequent dates

C.2.2.2.5.2 Range Matching of Attributes of VR of TM.

a. A string of the form "`time1` - `time2`", where `time1` is less or equal to `time2`, shall match all occurrences of times that fall between `time1` and `time2` inclusive

b. A string of the form "- `time1`" shall match all occurrences of times prior to and including `time1`

c. A string of the form "`time1` -" shall match all occurrences of `time1` and subsequent times

C.2.2.2.5.3 Range Matching of Attributes of VR of DT.

a. A string of the form "`datetime1` - `datetime2`", where `datetime` is less or equal to `datetime2`, shall match all moments in time that fall between `datetime1` and `datetime2` inclusive

b. A string of the form "- `datetime1`" shall match all moments in time prior to and including `datetime1`

c. A string of the form "`datetime1` -" shall match all moments in time subsequent to and including `datetime1`

d. The offset from Universal Coordinated Time, if present in the Value of the Attribute, shall be taken into account for the purposes of the match.

C.2.2.2.5.4 Range Matching General Rules

If Extended Negotiation of combined datetime matching is successful, then a pair of Attributes that are of VR DA and TM, both of which specify the same form of Range Matching, shall have the concatenated string values of each Range Matching component matched as if they were a single Attribute of VR DT.

```csharp
public struct DateRange : IEquatable<DateRange>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DateRange](daterange)() | Creates a default instance of the [`DateRange`](../daterange) staring from MinValue till MaxValue. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Maximum](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/maximum) { get; set; } | Maximum value in a range, inclusive. If not specified, then shall match all moments prior to and including [`Minimum`](./minimum). Read / Write [`DateTime`](../datetime). |
| [Minimum](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/minimum) { get; set; } | Minimum value in a range, inclusive. If not specified, then shall match all moments subsequent to and including [`Maximum`](./maximum). Read / Write [`DateTime`](../datetime). |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Equals](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/equals#equals)(DateRange) |  |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/equals#equals_1)(object) |  |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/gethashcode)() |  |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/tostring)() |  |
| static [TryParseExact](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/tryparseexact)(string, string[], IFormatProvider, DateTimeStyles, out DateRange) | Converts the specified string representation of a date range to its [`DateRange`](../daterange) equivalent. |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/op_equality) | Determines whether two specified ranges have the same value. |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/op_inequality) | Determines whether two specified ranges have different values. |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [Default](../../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/daterange/default) | The default value of the date range staring from MinValue till MaxValue . |
