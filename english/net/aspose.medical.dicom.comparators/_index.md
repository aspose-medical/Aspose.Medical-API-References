Two datasets considered to be equal if: 1) they have the same number of data elements; 2) for each position (index) data elements must be equal. Two data elements considered to be equal if: 1) they have the same [`Tag`](../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/ielement/tag); 2) they have the same [`ValueRepresentation`](../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/ielement/valuerepresentation); 3) element's data are the same for both elements. |
| [DicomFileEqualityComparer](./dicomfileequalitycomparer) | Represents a [`DicomFile`](../aspose.medical.dicom/dicomfile) comparison operation. Two DICOM files considered to be equal if: 1) their [`MetaInfo`](../aspose.medical.dicom/dicomfile/metainfo) are equal; 2) their [`Dataset`](../aspose.medical.dicom/dicomfile/dataset) are equal. [`DatasetEqualityComparer`](../aspose.medical.dicom.comparators/datasetequalitycomparer) for the information about [`Dataset`](../aspose.medical.dicom/dataset), [`MetaInformation`](../aspose.medical.dicom/metainformation) comparison. |
| [ElementEqualityComparer](./elementequalitycomparer) | Represents a [`IElement`](../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/ielement) comparison operation. Two data elements considered to be equal if: 1) they have the same [`Tag`](../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/ielement/tag); 2) they have the same [`ValueRepresentation`](../aspose.medical.dicom.elements/ielement/valuerepresentation); 3) element's data are the same for both elements. |
